#### Support for Public (Open-Source) and Private (Closed-Source) Repositories

This template fully supports both public/open-source and private/closed-source repositories. See [Public vs Private Repos](docs/public_vs_private_repos.md) for the difference.

#### Support for Existing Projects

Postmodern templates are designed to allow either the creation of new templates from scratch or adoption for existing projects with existing code repos.

#### Support for Template Updates

Keeping projects in sync with their parent template is a core feature of [Copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier), and this template will deploy a GitHub Actions Workflow/Azure DevOps Pipeline that will automate the update process.
