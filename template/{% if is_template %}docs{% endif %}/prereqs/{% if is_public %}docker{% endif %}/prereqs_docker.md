# Prerequisites via Docker

All that is needed for using the Docker container is having Docker (or another Docker-compatible tool) installed on your machine. For most cases, I would recommend installing Docker Desktop via [their instructions](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Docker CE on Linux and podman should also work fine (as long as you have an alias set up of 'docker' to 'podman').
