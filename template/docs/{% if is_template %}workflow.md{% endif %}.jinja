# Workflow for Using Template

## Creating New Project

## Applying to Existing Project

To apply this template to an existing project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your project is already using Git, and the all of the following are true:
    1. Project is checked out to your local computer
    1. All changes are committed
    1. Default branch is checked out
1. Create a new branch (`copier-template-apply`, for example) from your default branch
1. Run the following in order to apply the template to your local project, changing that path as appropriate:

{%- if using_github %}
    ``` shell
    copier copy --trust --overwrite gh:{{ github_org }}{{ github_username }}/{{ repo_name }} /path/to/project
    ```
{%- endif %}
{%- if using_azdo %}
    ``` shell
    copier copy --trust --overwrite git+https://dev.azure.com/{{ azdo_org }}/{{ azdo_project }}/_git/{{ repo_name }} /path/to/project
    ```
{%- endif %}


1. Make sure to choose `Set Repo Rules` in the first question
1. Set all other settings as appropriate for your project
1. Once the template is applied, review files that have been changed using git, and stage, discard, or modify as appropriate
1. Commit and push the changes to GitHub/Azure DevOps, then merge them via a Pull Request
1. You are done, and your project will now operate the same as one that was generated from this template.
