# Postmodern Repo Copier Template

[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/all-contributors/natescherer/postmodern-repo-copiertemplate?color=ee8449&style=flat-square)](#contributors)

| :exclamation: Notice: This project is currently in a Pre-Alpha state and is not ready for public use. |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

A [Copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier) template for creating a basic repository with full, all-the-bells-and-whistles CI/CD. (And for creating other templates!)

This template is heavily inspired by the [Hypermodern Python Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter-hypermodern-python.readthedocs.io).

Why Postmodern? Besides being a cheeky homage to this template's inspiration, I think that Postmodern philosophy's idea of the relativity of truth applies very well to software. There's no objectively best way to do CI/CD, this is just one way that works, and it might work for you too!

## Included Features

### Core

#### Support for Multiple CI/CD Platforms

- GitHub **Recommended**
  - Creating repos under both users and orgs is supported
  - See [GitHub Org Limitations](docs/github_org_limitations.md) for details about template features excluded for Orgs
- Azure DevOps
  - See [Azure DevOps Limitations](docs/azure_devops_limitations.md) for details about features missing for AzDO

#### Support for Public (Open-Source) and Private (Closed-Source) Repositories

This template fully supports both public/open-source and private/closed-source repositories. See [Public vs Private Repos](docs/public_vs_private_repos.md) for the difference.

#### Support for Existing Projects

Postmodern templates are designed to allow either the creation of new templates from scratch or adoption for existing projects with existing code repos.

#### Support for Template Updates

Keeping projects in sync with their parent template is a core feature of [Copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier), and this template will deploy a GitHub Actions Workflow/Azure DevOps Pipeline that will automate the update process.

#### Support for Child/Recursive Templates

It is highly encouraged for you to take this template and make your own child template that meets your needs. Your child template can (optionally) receive updates from this template.
